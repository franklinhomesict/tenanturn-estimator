# TenanTurn Executive Dashboard — Refresh Runbook

## Purpose
This file is the handoff for future ChatGPT sessions. Read this **before refreshing or changing dashboard data** so the operating logic does not have to be reconstructed.

## Live app
- Public URL: https://tenanturn.vercel.app
- Current dashboard lineage: v17
- Vercel project: `tenanturn-dashboard`
- GitHub repo: `franklinhomesict/tenanturn-estimator`
- Default branch: `main`
- Frontend: Vite + React
- Main dashboard file: `src/App.jsx`
- Browser title: `TenanTurn Executive Dashboard`
- Logo: TenanTurn logo from JobTread organization record
- GitHub `main` auto-deploys to Vercel production.

## Source of truth
**JobTread is the source of truth for operating and financial dashboard data.**

Do not refresh the dashboard from an old spreadsheet, previous dashboard snapshot, prior ChatGPT numbers, or memory. Always query JobTread live first.

## Critical TenanTurn operating rules
1. **Draft invoices are placeholders only.** They are not A/R, not billing queue, not evidence a job is ready to bill, and do not affect financial stage until actually issued.
2. **Pending Bid** = price sent; waiting for customer yes/no.
3. **Backlog** = approved job with no vendor/work-order assignment yet.
4. A **work order/vendor assignment is the first assignment signal**.
5. **Assigned / Not Started** = vendor assigned but no reliable evidence work has actually started.
6. **WIP** = work that has actually started and remains unfinished/unbilled. Verify start using work orders plus logs, comments, messages, photos, or other communication. Vendors may work without interacting with JobTread.
7. **Complete / Billed** = invoice actually sent.
8. **Paid** = payment received.
9. Large phased jobs may contain paid/billed portions and WIP at the same time. Only unfinished/unbilled work remains WIP.
10. Approved change orders on an active started job are WIP. If approved before any work begins, follow backlog/assigned logic until actual start.
11. **Pass-through reimbursements are not performance revenue and not performance cost.** Remove them from both sides of profitability calculations.
12. **Deposits/prepayments before work is performed are unearned customer cash**, not earned revenue/profit until work is performed.
13. Roofing and other contractor services belong in company totals but should be broken out separately from Make Ready work.
14. Blu, Blu 2, and SB are normal paying customers. Keep **billing account** separate from **work source/referral source** when JobTread notes identify the source.
15. A denied/revised proposal version is not automatically a lost job. A **true lost job** requires final communication/outcome showing the customer chose another option, declined, or otherwise did not proceed.
16. For vendor capacity, use **assignment/work-order date → done date** as cycle length. Do not infer actual days worked from log frequency. Calculate billable dollars generated over elapsed normal five-day workweek.
17. Profit terminology: **Job Profit = earned revenue − vendor labor − payment/Instant Pay fees − other true job costs.** Do not call this company net profit unless complete overhead has been included.
18. Track historical Instant Pay fees separately. Instant Pay is currently off.

## Refresh procedure
When Ian asks to “refresh,” “pull fresh data,” “update the dashboard,” or similar:

1. Query live JobTread data for the current reporting period and prior comparison period.
2. Rebuild current stages from source evidence:
   - Pending Bids
   - Backlog
   - Assigned / Not Started
   - WIP
   - Sent & Unpaid A/R
   - Paid
3. Ignore draft invoices when determining stage or A/R.
4. Review logs/comments/messages/photos where needed to distinguish assigned work from actual WIP.
5. Reconcile paid invoices:
   - remove reimbursements from revenue and cost
   - exclude unearned deposits/prepayments
   - include real production/vendor cost
   - include verified payment/Instant Pay fees
6. Reconcile cash separately from earned performance. Cash In/Out is not the same as earned revenue/profit.
7. Re-check true lost jobs from actual outcome notes/communication.
8. Re-check vendor assignment and completion dates before capacity calculations.
9. Surface data-integrity exceptions explicitly instead of forcing uncertain records into a category.
10. Cross-check totals before editing the app. If something does not reconcile, investigate rather than guessing.
11. Update `src/App.jsx` with the newly verified dataset and dates.
12. Commit to `main`; Vercel should auto-deploy.
13. Verify production deployment is READY and confirm https://tenanturn.vercel.app loads after deployment.

## Accuracy standard
This dashboard is used to make real business decisions. **Never carry forward a number merely because it appeared in a prior version.** Re-query and re-verify live JobTread records. When evidence is incomplete, under-count or label it uncertain rather than manufacture precision.

## Known caution from v17
The first deployed React conversion of v17 contained a mismatch involving the Minneapolis prepayment: display text said the prepayment was excluded while some displayed totals still embedded it. Therefore, **do not treat the current static financial values in `src/App.jsx` as authoritative for the next refresh.** Recalculate them from live JobTread.

## Dashboard design intent
The app should let Ian and Brandon quickly answer:
- What is coming in?
- What has been won but not assigned?
- What is assigned but not started?
- What work is actually in progress?
- What has been billed and is unpaid?
- What is making money?
- Where are margin, capacity, collection, or data-quality problems?

Keep the interface executive-level and concise. Let the app do the talking; avoid excessive explanatory copy.
